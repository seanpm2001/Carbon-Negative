# Carbon negative

The technology at my house has been carbon negative since day 1. Once I get my own server running, it will also be carbon negative from day 1. We haven't even put up solar panels yet, so how did we do this?

All of our electricity comes from either hydroelectric dams or windmills.

The Green Team of Seanpm2001 will continue to keep services running carbon negative, even on 0 day events. This is part of my effort in [:octocat: `climate activism`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Climate-Activism/) and protection.

## What is carbon negative?

[**Excerpt from:** `terrapass.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-carbon-negative/`](https://terrapass.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-carbon-negative)

"Carbon negative means, in effect, that you emit less than zero carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) greenhouse gasses. However, since it is impossible to emit a negative amount of carbon (or any other physical substance), being carbon negative refers to the net emissions you create. To be carbon negative means to offset more carbon, through carbon capture, sequestration, or avoidance, than you contribute to the environment."

## Other companies who have gone carbon negative before 2022
